#LabRat

A game made for Android mobile devices, using the gyroscope sensors to move a rat through a maze. The goal is to reach the cheese and avoid the mouse traps.

The game was made in 2022 for a course at Ume√• University in Sweden. It was created using Android Studio and Kotlin. I've made the game engine myself.
